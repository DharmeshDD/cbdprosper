Of the cannabinoids, CBD is the most abundant making up 40% of the plant’s extract. When ingested, it acts as a plant supplement for the body’s chemical needs and can provide many health benefits.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two different species of the cannabis plant, Hemp and Marijuana. All of our CBD products come from the industrial hemp plant which contains high amounts of CBD and other cannabinoids and low amounts of THC (0.3% or less). Marijuana, on the other hand, contains high amounts of THC and low amounts of CBD. The anti-psychotic CBD is the most abundant cannabinoids and serves as the biggest medicinal benefactor. Unlike many pharmaceuticals, CBD does not have any harmful side effects. At CBD Plus USA, our CBD products are 100% organic, non-GMO, and do not contain fillers.<\/p>"

Through the use of the body’s very own endo-cannabinoid system, CBD products can help restore the body back to its natural chemical levels.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Endocannabinoid system produces cannabinoids that mothers share with infants through breast milk. These cannabinoids help the infant grow new cells and thrive. The same system, in adults, can help clean cells, repair damaged ones, and can help grow new ones.<\/p>",
          "left-text": "<p>Endocannabinoid receptors can go dormant, making it difficult for the body to utilize the molecule. CBD works by attaching itself to the CB1 and CB2 receptors in the Endocannabinoid system. Consistency over a 30-day period is often required to activate dormant receptors. The more receptors that are active, the better your body can utilize the CBD molecules.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition, CBD and other cannabinoids supplement the body’s ability to regulate natural functions and maintain homeostasis. Achieving normal levels (homeostasis) at the cellular level rejuvenates the body’s ability to heal itself and flourish.<\/p>\n\n<p>When your body gets back to those normal levels, you can start feeling like yourself again; you can get your life back!<\/p>",
